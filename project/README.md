# PetPaws Rescue

## Overview

**PetPaws Rescue** is a website dedicated to connecting rescued pets with loving homes. The site is designed to showcase adoption profiles, share success stories, provide pet care resources, and offer opportunities for volunteering and donations. The goal is to create an engaging, accessible, and informative experience for potential adopters and volunteers.

## Rubric Compliance

### 1. Naming Conventions
- **Files and Folders:**  
  All files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) follow the naming conventions specified in the course requirements. For example, HTML files are named in lowercase (e.g., `index.html`), and CSS files are placed in a dedicated folder (`styles/siteplan.css`).

### 2. HTML Validation
- **Validation Report:**  
  The HTML has been validated using the [W3C Nu Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu) and reports no errors. Minor warnings and informational messages are acknowledged and will be reviewed by the student.

### 3. CSS Validation
- **Validation Report:**  
  The CSS has been validated using the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) with no errors reported. Any warnings are noted and under review.

### 4. Site Name
- **Name:** PetPaws Rescue  
- **Rationale:**  
  The name reflects the mission of the organization—to rescue and rehome pets. It is simple, memorable, and clearly communicates the purpose of the site.

### 5. Site Purpose
- **Purpose:**  
  The site aims to connect rescued pets with potential adopters by showcasing detailed adoption profiles, sharing success stories, and offering resources and volunteer/donation opportunities.

### 6. Scenarios
- **Scenario 1:**  
  A busy professional visits the website looking for a pet that matches their active lifestyle. They want quick access to pet profiles and adoption information.
- **Scenario 2:**  
  A family with children explores the site to find a gentle and interactive pet. They require clear details on pet behavior, availability, and ways to get involved (adoption, volunteering, donations).

### 7. Color Schema
- **Defined Colors:**  
  - **Primary Color:** `#2C3E50` (used for main text, backgrounds, and headers)
  - **Accent Color:** `#B03022` (used for buttons, links, and highlights)
- **Usage:**  
  The colors are consistently applied throughout the CSS, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing design.

### 8. Typography
- **Selected Fonts:**  
  - **Montserrat:** Applied to headings for a modern, bold look.
  - **Open Sans:** Applied to body text to ensure readability.
- **Implementation:**  
  Both fonts are imported via Google Fonts and integrated into the CSS to enhance the site’s overall design.

### 9. Wireframes
- **Wireframe Sketches:**  
  Two wireframe sketches have been created:
  - **Mobile View Wireframe:** Outlines the layout for smaller devices.
  - **Desktop View Wireframe:** Provides a layout for larger viewports.
- These sketches are included as separate files within the project documentation.

## Conclusion

This project meets all the rubric requirements by ensuring proper file naming, valid HTML/CSS, a clearly defined site name and purpose, user scenarios, a consistent color scheme and typography, and comprehensive wireframes.
