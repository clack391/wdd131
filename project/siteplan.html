            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <p>Mountain Trails</p>
            <p>I chose "Mountain Trails" because it clearly communicates the focus on mountain trail exploration while being memorable and easy to pronounce. The alliteration makes it catchy, and it suggests the idea of journeying to mountain summits and exploring various trail options.</p>

                <li><strong>Secondary Green (#4e8d71):</strong> Used for secondary elements, subheadings, and hover states. This lighter green provides contrast while maintaining the natural theme.</li>
                <li><strong>Accent Orange (#f9a826):</strong> Used for buttons, call-to-action elements, and highlights. This vibrant orange represents sunlight filtering through trees and draws attention to important elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Text Dark Gray (#333333):</strong> Used for body text and content. This dark gray ensures readability while being less harsh than pure black.</li>
